This is a test project for a mechanical z-axis for the Shapoko 2 to move the motor out of the way and provide better clearance for large spindles such as the dewalt 611.

The power of OpenScad is shown in the easy to understand source files.

It uses herringbone gears to reduce/eleminate backlash caused by traditional gear meshing tolerances 

The idler gear is intended to have 2 sandwitched 608 bearings and an 8mm hub.  5/16 works in a pinch.   

The leadscrew gear is intended to be used with the stock shapeoko flanged bearing that came in the kit.  Optionaly a second bearing (standard 608) can sandwitch the gear and held down with to top_br_zplate to add stability.

The gears are designed to be printed on a well tuned 3d printer. 
The plates are designed to be machined out of aluminum using the Shapeoko 2.
They will be printed for a fitting prototype to ensure all dimensions and tolerances.
The zplate will be machined first.
